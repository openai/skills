## Contributing

### Community values

- **Be kind and inclusive.** Treat others with respect; we follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
- **Assume good intent.** Written communication is hard - err on the side of generosity.
- **Teach & learn.** If you spot something confusing, open an issue or PR with improvements.

### Contributor license agreement (CLA)

All contributors **must** accept the CLA. The process is lightweight:

1. Open your pull request.
2. Paste the following comment (or reply `recheck` if you've signed before):

   ```text
   I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA
   ```

3. The CLA-Assistant bot records your signature in the repo and marks the status check as passed.

No special Git commands, email attachments, or commit footers required.
