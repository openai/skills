# Linear

## Overview

This skill provides a structured workflow for managing issues, projects & team workflows in Linear. It ensures consistent integration with the Linear MCP server, which offers natural-language project management for issues, projects, documentation, and team collaboration.

## Prerequisites
- Linear MCP server must be connected to `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp` and accessible via OAuth or a configured `LINEAR_API_KEY`
- Confirm access to the relevant Linear workspace, teams, and projects

## Required Workflow

**Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.**

### Step 0: Set up Linear MCP (if not already configured)

If any MCP call fails because Linear MCP is not connected, uses the deprecated `/sse` endpoint, or returns a "pre-removal deprecation signal", pause and set it up:

1. Add the Linear MCP:
   - `codex mcp add linear --url https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`
   - If a stale `linear` server already exists, remove or edit it so it uses `https://mcp.linear.app/mcp`, not `https://mcp.linear.app/sse`.
2. Enable remote MCP client:
   - Set `[features] rmcp_client = true` in `config.toml` **or** run `codex --enable rmcp_client`
3. Log in with OAuth:
   - `codex mcp login linear`

After successful login, the user will have to restart codex. You should finish your answer and tell them so when they try again they can continue with Step 1.

**Windows/WSL note:** If you see connection errors on Windows, try configuring the Linear MCP to run via WSL:
```json
{"mcpServers": {"linear": {"command": "wsl", "args": ["npx", "-y", "mcp-remote", "https://mcp.linear.app/mcp"]}}}
```

### Step 1
Clarify the user's goal and scope (e.g., issue triage, sprint planning, documentation audit, workload balance). Confirm team/project, priority, labels, cycle, and due dates as needed.

### Step 2
Select the appropriate workflow (see Practical Workflows below) and identify the Linear MCP tools you will need. Confirm required identifiers (issue ID, project ID, team key) before calling tools.

### Step 3
Execute Linear MCP tool calls in logical batches:
- Read first (list/get/search) to build context.
- Create or update next (issues, projects, labels, comments) with all required fields.
- For bulk operations, explain the grouping logic before applying changes.

### Step 4
Summarize results, call out remaining gaps or blockers, and propose next actions (additional issues, label changes, assignments, or follow-up comments).

## Available Tools

Tool names vary by MCP server version; discover tools at runtime. Current Linear MCP commonly exposes `save_*` upsert-style tools instead of separate `create_*` and `update_*` tools.

Issue Management: `list_issues`, `get_issue`, `save_issue`, `list_issue_statuses`, `list_issue_labels`, `create_issue_label`

Project & Team: `save_project`, `save_initiative`, `save_milestone`, `list_teams`, `list_users`, plus project/team list or get tools when exposed

Documentation & Collaboration: `save_document`, `list_comments`, `save_comment`, `list_cycles`, plus documentation search tools when exposed

## Practical Workflows

- Sprint Planning: Review open issues for a target team, pick top items by priority, and create a new cycle (e.g., "Q1 Performance Sprint") with assignments.
- Bug Triage: List critical/high-priority bugs, rank by user impact, and move the top items to "In Progress."
- Documentation Audit: Search documentation (e.g., API auth), then open labeled "documentation" issues for gaps or outdated sections with detailed fixes.
- Team Workload Balance: Group active issues by assignee, flag anyone with high load, and suggest or apply redistributions.
- Release Planning: Create a project (e.g., "v2.0 Release") with milestones (feature freeze, beta, docs, launch) and generate issues with estimates.
- Cross-Project Dependencies: Find all "blocked" issues, identify blockers, and create linked issues if missing.
- Automated Status Updates: Find your issues with stale updates and add status comments based on current state/blockers.
- Smart Labeling: Analyze unlabeled issues, suggest/apply labels, and create missing label categories.
- Sprint Retrospectives: Generate a report for the last completed cycle, note completed vs. pushed work, and open discussion issues for patterns.

## Tips for Maximum Productivity

- Batch operations for related changes; consider smart templates for recurring issue structures.
- Use natural queries when possible ("Show me what John is working on this week").
- Leverage context: reference prior issues in new requests.
- Break large updates into smaller batches to avoid rate limits; cache or reuse filters when listing frequently.

## Troubleshooting

- Authentication: Clear browser cookies, re-run OAuth, verify workspace permissions, ensure API access is enabled.
- Tool Calling Errors: Confirm the model supports multiple tool calls, provide all required fields, and split complex requests.
- Missing Data: Refresh token, verify workspace access, check for archived projects, and confirm correct team selection.
- Performance: Remember Linear API rate limits; batch bulk operations, use specific filters, or cache frequent queries.
