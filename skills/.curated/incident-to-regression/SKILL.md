# Incident To Regression

Use this skill to transform an observed incident into deterministic regression checks.

## Gait Context

Gait is an offline-first runtime for AI agents that enforces tool-boundary policy, emits signed and verifiable evidence artifacts, and supports deterministic regressions.

Use this skill when:
- incident triage needs repeatable regression fixtures
- CI gate failures need deterministic reproduction
- evidence outputs must be generated from Gait artifacts

Do not use this skill when:
- Gait CLI is unavailable in the environment
- no Gait run/pack artifact or run identifier is available as input

## Required Inputs

- `run_source`: run id, runpack path, or equivalent source accepted by `gait regress init`.
- `workdir`: writable working directory where fixtures and outputs will be created.

## Workflow

1. Enter the declared working directory before generating artifacts:
   - `mkdir -p <workdir> && cd <workdir>`
2. Initialize deterministic fixture from the incident source:
   - `gait regress init --from <run_source> --json`
3. Parse fields from init output and record them:
   - `ok`, `run_id`, `fixture_name`, `fixture_dir`, `config_path`, `next_commands`
4. Execute regression graders:
   - `gait regress run --json`
5. If CI evidence is needed, rerun with JUnit output:
   - `gait regress run --json --junit <junit_path>`
6. Return a concise summary with:
   - source identifier
   - fixture directory and config path
   - status and failed grader count
   - evidence output paths

## Safety And Portability Rules

- Use CLI outputs only; do not infer grader results from config text.
- Treat non-zero regress exit codes as actionable outcomes, not warnings.
- Do not assume repository-specific fixture paths.
- Keep paths relative to the active workspace unless the user explicitly asks for absolute paths.

## Usage Example

```bash
mkdir -p ./regress-workdir && cd ./regress-workdir
gait regress init --from run_demo --json
gait regress run --json --junit ./artifacts/junit.xml
```

Expected result:
- init output includes `ok=true` and a `fixture_dir`
- run output includes stable `status` and grader failure details
- JUnit file exists at `./artifacts/junit.xml`

## Validation Example

```bash
mkdir -p ./regress-workdir && cd ./regress-workdir
gait regress run --json > ./artifacts/regress_result.json
python3 - <<'PY'
import json
from pathlib import Path
p = json.loads(Path('./artifacts/regress_result.json').read_text(encoding='utf-8'))
assert p.get('status') in {'pass', 'fail'}
print('validated status:', p.get('status'))
PY
```

Expected result:
- script prints `validated status: pass` or `validated status: fail`

## Provider Notes (OpenAI Codex)

- Invoke explicitly as `$incident-to-regression` when asking Codex to run this workflow.
- Keep outputs grounded in command results and `--json` payload fields.
