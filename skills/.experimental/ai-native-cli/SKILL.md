  AI-Native CLI design spec for building agent-friendly command-line tools.
  Use when building CLI tools, designing command-line interfaces, scaffolding
  new CLI projects, or auditing existing CLIs for agent compatibility.
  Provides 98 rules across 11 dimensions (output, error, exit codes, input,
  safety, guardrails, composability, naming, discoverability, feedback, meta)
  with three certification levels (Agent-Friendly, Agent-Ready, Agent-Native).
  Includes a full audit protocol in references/audit.md for verifying compliance.

# Agent-Friendly CLI Spec v0.1

When building or modifying CLI tools, follow these rules to make them safe and
reliable for AI agents to use.

**Audit protocol**: To audit an existing CLI against this spec, read
[references/audit.md](references/audit.md) for the step-by-step protocol.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Agent-first** -- default output is JSON; human-friendly is opt-in via `--human`
2. **Agent is untrusted** -- validate all input at the same level as a public API
3. **Fail-Closed** -- when validation logic itself errors, deny by default
4. **Verifiable** -- every rule is written so it can be automatically checked

## Layer Model

This spec now uses two orthogonal axes:

- **Layer** answers rollout scope: `core`, `recommended`, `ecosystem`
- **Priority** answers severity: `P0`, `P1`, `P2`

Use layers for migration and certification:

- **core** -- execution contract: JSON, errors, exit codes, stdout/stderr, safety
- **recommended** -- better machine UX: self-description, explicit modes, richer schemas
- **ecosystem** -- agent-native integration: `agent/`, `skills`, `issue`, inline context

Certification maps to layers:

- **Agent-Friendly** -- all `core` rules pass
- **Agent-Ready** -- all `core` + `recommended` rules pass
- **Agent-Native** -- all layers pass

## Output Mode

Default is agent mode (JSON). Explicit flags to switch:

```bash
$ mycli list              # default = JSON output (agent mode)
$ mycli list --human      # human-friendly: colored, tables, formatted
$ mycli list --agent      # explicit agent mode (override config if needed)
```

- **Default (no flag)** — JSON to stdout. Agent never needs to add a flag.
- **--human** — human-friendly format (colors, tables, progress bars)
- **--agent** — explicit JSON mode (useful when env/config overrides default)

## agent/ Directory Convention

Every CLI tool MUST have an `agent/` directory at its project root. This is the
tool's identity and behavior contract for AI agents.

```
agent/
├── brief.md          # One paragraph: who am I, what can I do
├── rules/            # Behavior constraints (auto-registered)
│   ├── trigger.md    # When should an agent use this tool
│   ├── workflow.md   # Step-by-step usage flow
│   └── writeback.md  # How to write feedback back
└── skills/           # Extended capabilities (auto-registered)
    └── getting-started.md
```

### File Format

**agent/brief.md** — plain text, one paragraph. No frontmatter needed.

**agent/rules/*.md** — each file MUST have YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: trigger
description: When should an agent use this tool
---
(content here)
```

**agent/skills/*.md** — each file MUST have YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: getting-started
description: Quick start guide for new users
---
(content here)
```

The `name` field is the canonical identifier. The `description` field tells agents
when/why to read this rule or skill.

### Auto-Registration

Drop a `.md` file into `agent/rules/` or `agent/skills/` and it is automatically
registered. The CLI reads these directories at runtime. No code changes needed.

## Four Levels of Self-Description

### Level 1: --brief (business card, injected into agent config)

The smallest possible context. Output of `--brief` gets synced into CLAUDE.md /
AGENTS.md by `cli-toolkit sync-agent`, so agents always know this tool exists.

```bash
$ mycli --brief
mycli — task manager, add/list/show/done for local tasks
```

Source: `agent/brief.md`. Just one paragraph. Always in agent's system prompt.

### Level 2: Every Command Response (always-on context)

EVERY command's JSON output MUST include three fixed fields:

```json
{
  "result": { "id": 1, "title": "Buy milk", "status": "todo" },

  "rules": [
    {"name": "trigger",   "content": "full content of trigger.md"},
    {"name": "workflow",  "content": "full content of workflow.md"},
    {"name": "writeback", "content": "full content of writeback.md"}
  ],
  "skills": [
    {"name": "getting-started", "description": "Quick start guide", "command": "mycli skills getting-started"},
    {"name": "batch-import",    "description": "Import from CSV",   "command": "mycli skills batch-import"}
  ],
  "issue": "Any problem, bad output, or confusion — run: mycli issue create --type <bug|requirement|suggestion|bad-output> --message '...'"
}
```

- **rules** — full `.md` content inline (push: agent must know)
- **skills** — name + description + command (pull: agent reads on demand)
- **issue** — one-line guide, always present (fallback: can't figure it out? report it)

These three fields form a closed loop:
  rules tell you how -> skills teach you more -> issue catches what you can't handle

### Level 3: --help (full self-description)

Complete identity + capabilities. Only called for deep exploration.

```json
{
  "help": "mycli — full description from agent/brief.md",
  "commands": [
    {"name": "add",  "description": "Create a new task"},
    {"name": "list", "description": "List all tasks"},
    {"name": "done", "description": "Mark task as done (destructive)"}
  ],
  "rules": [
    {"name": "trigger",   "content": "..."},
    {"name": "workflow",  "content": "..."},
    {"name": "writeback", "content": "..."}
  ],
  "skills": [
    {"name": "getting-started", "description": "Quick start guide", "command": "mycli skills getting-started"}
  ],
  "issue": "Any problem — run: mycli issue create ..."
}
```

### Level 4: skills <name> (on-demand deep dive)

```bash
$ mycli skills getting-started
{
  "name": "getting-started",
  "content": "full content of getting-started.md",
  "rules": [ ... same rules for context ... ]
}
```

### Summary: Information Architecture

```
--brief              → always in agent's prompt (via sync-agent)
every command        → data + rules + skills list + issue (always attached)
--help               → brief + commands + rules + skills + issue (first contact)
skills <name>        → full skill content + rules (on demand)
```

## Certification Requirements

Each level includes all rules from the previous level.
Priority tag `[P0]`=agent breaks without it, `[P1]`=agent works but poorly, `[P2]`=nice to have.

### Level 1: Agent-Friendly (core — 20 rules)

Goal: CLI is a stable, callable API. Agent can invoke, parse, and handle errors.

**Output** — default is JSON, stable schema
- `[P0]` O1: Default output is JSON. No `--json` flag needed
- `[P0]` O2: JSON MUST pass `jq .` validation
- `[P0]` O3: JSON schema MUST NOT change within same version

**Error** — structured, to stderr, never interactive
- `[P0]` E1: Errors → `{"error":true, "code":"...", "message":"...", "suggestion":"..."}` to stderr
- `[P0]` E4: Error has machine-readable `code` (e.g. `MISSING_REQUIRED`)
- `[P0]` E5: Error has human-readable `message`
- `[P0]` E7: On error, NEVER enter interactive mode — exit immediately
- `[P0]` E8: Error codes are API contracts — MUST NOT rename across versions

**Exit Code** — predictable failure signals
- `[P0]` X3: Parameter/usage errors MUST exit 2
- `[P0]` X9: Failures MUST exit non-zero — never exit 0 then report error in stdout

**Composability** — clean pipe semantics
- `[P0]` C1: stdout is for data ONLY
- `[P0]` C2: logs, progress, warnings go to stderr ONLY

**Input** — fail fast on bad input
- `[P1]` I4: Missing required param → structured error, never interactive prompt
- `[P1]` I5: Type mismatch → exit 2 + structured error

**Safety** — protect against agent mistakes
- `[P1]` S1: Destructive ops require `--yes` confirmation
- `[P1]` S4: Reject `../../` path traversal, control chars

**Guardrails** — runtime input protection
- `[P1]` G1: Unknown flags rejected with exit 2
- `[P1]` G2: Detect API key / token patterns in args, reject execution
- `[P1]` G3: Reject sensitive file paths (*.env, *.key, *.pem)
- `[P1]` G8: Reject shell metacharacters in arguments (; | && $())

### Level 2: Agent-Ready (+ recommended — 59 rules)

Goal: CLI is self-describing, well-named, and pipe-friendly. Agent discovers capabilities and chains commands without trial and error.

**Self-Description** — agent discovers what CLI can do
- `[P1]` D1: `--help` outputs structured JSON with `commands[]`
- `[P1]` D3: Schema has required fields (help, commands)
- `[P1]` D4: All parameters have type declarations
- `[P1]` D7: Parameters annotated as required/optional
- `[P1]` D9: Every command has a description
- `[P1]` D11: `--help` outputs JSON with help, rules, skills, commands
- `[P1]` D15: `--brief` outputs `agent/brief.md` content
- `[P1]` D16: Default JSON (agent mode), `--human` for human-friendly
- `[P2]` D2/D5/D6/D8/D10: per-command help, enums, defaults, output schema, version

**Input** — unambiguous calling convention
- `[P1]` I1: All flags use `--long-name` format
- `[P1]` I2: No positional argument ambiguity
- `[P2]` I3/I6/I7: --json-input, boolean --no-X, array params

**Error**
- `[P1]` E6: Error includes `suggestion` field
- `[P2]` E2/E3: errors to stderr, error JSON valid

**Safety**
- `[P1]` S8: `--sanitize` flag for external input
- `[P2]` S2/S3/S5/S6/S7: default deny, --dry-run, no auto-update, destructive marking

**Exit Code**
- `[P1]` X1: 0 = success
- `[P2]` X2/X4-X8: 1=general, 10=auth, 11=permission, 20=not-found, 30=conflict

**Composability**
- `[P1]` C6: No interactive prompts in pipe mode
- `[P2]` C3/C4/C5/C7: pipe-friendly, --quiet, pipe chain, idempotency

**Naming** — predictable flag conventions
- `[P1]` N4: Reserved flags (--agent, --human, --brief, --help, --version, --yes, --dry-run, --quiet, --fields)
- `[P2]` N1/N2/N3/N5/N6: consistent naming, kebab-case, max 3 levels, --version semver

**Guardrails**
- `[P1]` I8/I9: no implicit state, non-interactive auth
- `[P1]` G6/G9: precondition checks, fail-closed
- `[P2]` G4/G5/G7: permission levels, PII redaction, batch limits

#### Reserved Flags

| Flag | Semantics | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `--agent` | JSON output (default) | Explicit override |
| `--human` | Human-friendly output | Colors, tables, formatted |
| `--brief` | One-paragraph identity | For sync into agent config |
| `--help` | Full self-description JSON | Brief + commands + rules + skills + issue |
| `--version` | Semver version string | |
| `--yes` | Confirm destructive ops | Required for delete/destroy |
| `--dry-run` | Preview without executing | |
| `--quiet` | Suppress stderr output | |
| `--fields` | Filter output fields | Save tokens |

### Level 3: Agent-Native (+ ecosystem — 19 rules)

Goal: CLI has identity, behavior contract, skill system, and feedback loop. Agent can learn the tool, extend its use, and report problems — full closed-loop collaboration.

**Agent Directory** — tool identity and behavior contract
- `[P1]` D12: `agent/brief.md` exists
- `[P1]` D13: `agent/rules/` has trigger.md, workflow.md, writeback.md
- `[P1]` D17: agent/rules/*.md have YAML frontmatter (name, description)
- `[P1]` D18: agent/skills/*.md have YAML frontmatter (name, description)
- `[P2]` D14: `agent/skills/` directory + `skills` subcommand

**Response Structure** — inline context on every call
- `[P1]` R1: Every response includes `rules[]` (full content from agent/rules/)
- `[P1]` R2: Every response includes `skills[]` (name + description + command)
- `[P1]` R3: Every response includes `issue` (feedback guide)

**Meta** — project-level integration
- `[P2]` M1: AGENTS.md at project root
- `[P2]` M2: Optional MCP tool schema export
- `[P2]` M3: CHANGELOG.md marks breaking changes

**Feedback** — built-in issue system
- `[P2]` F1: `issue` subcommand (create/list/show)
- `[P2]` F2: Structured submission with version/context/exit_code
- `[P2]` F3: Categories: bug / requirement / suggestion / bad-output
- `[P2]` F4: Issues stored locally, no external service dependency
- `[P2]` F5: `issue list` / `issue show <id>` queryable
- `[P2]` F6: Issues have status tracking (open/in-progress/resolved/closed)
- `[P2]` F7: Issue JSON has all required fields (id, type, status, message, created_at, updated_at)
- `[P2]` F8: All issues have status field

## Exit Code Table

```
0   success         10  auth failed       20  resource not found
1   general error   11  permission denied 30  conflict/precondition
2   param/usage error
```

## Error Format

```json
{
  "error": true,
  "code": "AUTH_EXPIRED",
  "message": "Access token expired 2 hours ago",
  "suggestion": "Run 'mycli auth refresh' to get a new token"
}
```

## Quick Implementation Checklist

Implement by layer — each phase gets you the next certification level.

**Phase 1: Agent-Friendly (core)**
1. Default output is JSON — no `--json` flag needed
2. Error handler: `{ error, code, message, suggestion }` to stderr
3. Exit codes: 0 success, 2 param error, 1 general
4. stdout = data only, stderr = logs only
5. Missing param → structured error (never interactive)
6. `--yes` guard on destructive operations
7. Guardrails: reject secrets, path traversal, shell metacharacters

**Phase 2: Agent-Ready (+ recommended)**
8. `--help` returns structured JSON (help, commands[], rules[], skills[])
9. `--brief` reads and outputs `agent/brief.md` content
10. `--human` flag switches to human-friendly format
11. Reserved flags: --agent, --version, --dry-run, --quiet, --fields
12. Exit codes: 20 not found, 30 conflict, 10 auth, 11 permission

**Phase 3: Agent-Native (+ ecosystem)**
13. Create `agent/` directory: `brief.md`, `rules/trigger.md`, `rules/workflow.md`, `rules/writeback.md`
14. Every command response appends: rules[] + skills[] + issue
15. `skills` subcommand: list all / show one with full content
16. `issue` subcommand for feedback (create/list/show/close/transition)
17. AGENTS.md at project root

## Issue System Specification

Every CLI tool MUST have a built-in issue system for agents to report problems,
request features, and track feedback.

### Storage

Issues are stored in a dedicated directory:

```
~/.{toolname}/issues/       # or {TOOL_DIR}/issues/
├── 001.json
├── 002.json
└── 003.json
```

Each issue is a single JSON file named `{id}.json`.

### Issue Fields

```json
{
  "id": "001",
  "type": "bug",
  "status": "open",
  "message": "list command returns empty when tasks exist",
  "context": {
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "command": "mycli list --json",
    "exit_code": 0
  },
  "created_at": "2026-03-14T00:00:00Z",
  "updated_at": "2026-03-14T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Required fields:
- **id** — unique identifier
- **type** — one of: `bug`, `requirement`, `suggestion`, `bad-output`
- **status** — one of: `open`, `in-progress`, `resolved`, `closed`
- **message** — description of the issue
- **context** — object with `version`, `command`, `exit_code`
- **created_at** — ISO 8601 timestamp
- **updated_at** — ISO 8601 timestamp

### State Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `issue create --type <type> --message <msg>` | Create a new issue |
| `issue list [--type <type>] [--status <status>]` | List issues, filterable |
| `issue show <id>` | Show single issue detail |
| `issue close <id>` | Close an issue |
| `issue transition <id> --status <status>` | Change issue status |

### Queryable

Issues MUST be filterable by `--type` and `--status`:

```bash
$ mycli issue list --type bug --status open
$ mycli issue list --status resolved
